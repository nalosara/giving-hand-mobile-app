**Giving Hand Mobile App**

Giving Gand Mobile Application is an application that allows users to sign up, see all available volunteering actions, and apply for the ones they are interested in. Furthermore, there is a user profile where they can see all of the actions they applied for.

We also made admin profiles that can add, edit and delete these actions. Admin profiles are automatically inserted to the database once the application is installed and users can't make new admin profiles. However, these admin profiles can log in as regular users and do everything that regular users can do as well.

We also managed to make a datasource with actions that is automatically loaded into the database once the application is installed.

For accessing the admin profiles you can use the following credentials:
1. username: tijanab    
   password: test123
2. username: saranalo     
   password: test123
3. username: aminatpkvc     
   password: testbest
